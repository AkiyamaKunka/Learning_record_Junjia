# Study Record 

By Junjia Wang

 ## Abstract
 This is A learning record of *Computer Science* field, like **CPP**, **algorithm** and so on. Started at the second half of my **freshman** year and until I become a qualified Software Engineer.

Sincerely appreciate so many brilliant platforms, which include 
_**[Github](https://github.com/), 
[Google](https://www.google.com/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)**_ that I utilized for searching and knowledge acquirement, additionally, those OJ platforms like _**[Luogu](https://www.luogu.com.cn/), [leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/), [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)**_ as a tremendous approach to enhance the capacity of coding and logic constructions, which drastically determines the likelihood of being admitted into a company in the visible future .

**The passion for exploring Unknown and the spirit of never giving up, is what that makes the IT world great.**
